## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Intent-Based Minting** — Just name your NFT and upload an image. We handle chain selection, gas, IPFS, and metadata.
- 🌐 **Cross-Chain Ready** — Create intents on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism — all from one interface.
- 🖼️ **Dynamic Gallery** — Minted NFTs appear instantly in the gallery — no refresh needed.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Intent Tracking** — See intent status (Pending → Executed ✅ / Failed ❌) with color-coded feedback.
- 🔐 **Decentralized by Design** — Images uploaded to IPFS (via Infura), metadata stored on-chain.
- 🧑‍💻 **Zero Blockchain Knowledge Required** — Perfect for Web2 users entering Web3.

## 🧠 Why This Matters for Anoma

Anoma’s core philosophy is **intent-centric interaction** — users should express *what* they want, not *how* to do it.

This demo embodies that:

- User says: _“I want to mint ‘Shrimpers NFT #7’.”_
- System does:  
  → Picks optimal chain (gas + speed)  
  → Uploads image to IPFS  
  → Generates metadata  
  → Mints NFT  
  → Adds to live gallery  
  → Tracks intents per chain

No wallets. No gas calculations. No chain switching.  
Just intent → execution.
